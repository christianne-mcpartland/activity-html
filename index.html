    <p> Avocado is a <strong>great source</strong> of monounsaturated oleic acid that research has shown to both reduce dangerous low-density lipoprotein cholesterol at the same time as increasing the more beneficial high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Avocados also contain a rich variety of heart nutrients including <em>Vitamin E</em> for preventing cholesterol oxidization; folate for reducing dangerous homocystenine levels in the blood; potassium for regulating blood pressure; phytosterols for reducing cholesterol absorption; and dietary fibre to control blood sugar levels.</p>
